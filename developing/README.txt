# Turtle Rescue

[Description]:
With this simple and intuitive side scroller tap tap game, we hope to raise
awareness about the state of the ocean and how it could affect marine's life.
We want the game to have a happy and cheerful vibe so that it is enjoyable
by people of all ages (but our main target audience is of age 8-14).
